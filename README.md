## EZ Series US sample

### There is the below sketch file I wrote to use MB1003

Sonia-1: it is simple file for using EZ MB1003 to read the distance

Sonia-2: Add one simple distance sentence to control LED blink

Sonia-3: Add the function which using distance to adjust LED blink sequence.

Sonia-4: Add the distance check portion on Sonia-3

Sonia-5: Use AN method to get the value and caculate the distance directly using read value x 5mm

Soina-6: Use AN method to get the value and caculate the distance using the below file to get it.

         1. Caculate the actual voltage
         2. Caculate the distance


## LM35DZ sample

### This is the below sketch file I wrote to use LM35

Voltage read: Use A0 to read the voltage
